abstract: >-
  Synchronising dynamic MRI acquisitions with physical force
  measurements enables standardised and normalised
  assessment of muscle activity but requires ad hoc sensors
  compatible with the MR environment. We aimed to develop an
  open-source, MRI-compatible grip force sensor for dynamic
  Muscle MRI. Phantom measurements with and without the
  sensor, with dynamic and anatomical scans, were performed
  at a 3T MRI to assess sensor compatibility, impact on
  field homogeneity and SNR potential. The grip force sensor
  maintained functionality with an additional low-pass
  filter installed in the waveguide. The SNR decreased
  slightly by 3.7% during the scans. The low-cost,
  open-source grip force sensor demonstrated excellent MRI
  compatibility and therefore appears to be suitable for use
  with dynamic muscle MRI methods to characterise forearm
  flexors, with potential applications in the study of
  myotonic dystrophy.

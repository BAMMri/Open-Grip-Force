# Open Grip Force Sensor for MRI

## 🚧 This project is currently under development🚧  

The **Open-Grip-Force** project is an open-source grip force sensor designed for MRI applications. Developed by the Basel Muscle MRI Group, this repository contains related documentation, data and code to build your own force sensor. Additionally, it includes datasets and scripts to reproduce figures from our publications currently under review.

Check out the [GUI and assembly instructions](https://github.com/fsantini/OpenForceMR) and the Arduino code for the [NMES & Trigger](https://github.com/BAMMri/EMS_Trigger_Force) extension.

Be conscious about different [versions](https://github.com/BAMMri/Open-Grip-Force/releases) of this repository.
